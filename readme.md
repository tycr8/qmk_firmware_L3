# Lemokey L3 Custom QMK Firmware - Staging

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) and the official [QMK Source](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/). This is based off the wireless_playground branch from the official QMK github. The goal here is to enable OpenRGB for more advanced lighting animations. This firmware has not yet been built or tested and should only be used as a learning tool until such tests have been completed. 
__This firmware only supports the Lemokey L3.__
